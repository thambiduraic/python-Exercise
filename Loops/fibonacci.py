# Display Fibonacci series up to 10 terms

# The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers.
# The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.
# The first two numbers are 0 and 1.

# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.

# Expected output:

# Fibonacci sequence:
# 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34

# first two numbers
num1, num2 = 0, 1

# Find the factorial of a given number
# Write a program to use the loop to find the factorial of a given number.

# The factorial (symbol: !)
# means to multiply all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.

# For example: calculate the factorial of 5

# 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
# Expected output:

# 120

elif num == 0:

else:
    # run loop 5 times
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        # multiply factorial by current number
        factorial = factorial * i

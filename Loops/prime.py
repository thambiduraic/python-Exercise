# Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range

# Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.
# A prime number is a natural number greater than 1
# that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

# Examples:

# 6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2×3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

# Given:

# # range
# start = 25
# end = 50

# Expected output:

# Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
# 29
# 31
# 37
# 41
# 43
# 47

start = 25
stop = 50

for num in range(start, stop + 1):
    # all prime numbers are greater than 1
    # if number is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime
    if num > 1:
        for i in range(2, num):
            # check for factors
            if (num % i) == 0:
                # not a prime number so break inner loop and
                # look for next number
                break
        else:
            print(num)
